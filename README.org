- Webrender support (experimental).
- SVG rendering not supported yet.
- xwidget not surpport yet.

*** Default build
- Self-contained Emacs.app application bundle, with no external dependencies.
- Javascript support (coming soon).
- Native compilation ([[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GccEmacs][gccemacs]]), only in Emacs 28.x and later builds.
- Native JSON parsing via libjansson.
- SVG rendering via librsvg.
- Various image formats are supported via macOS native image APIs.
- Xwidget-webkit support is enabled without Webrender, allowing access to a embedded WebKit-based browser with =M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url=.
- Native XML parsing via libxml2.
- Dynamic module loading.
- Includes the [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/blob/master/patches/emacs-28/fix-window-role.patch][fix-window-role]], [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/blob/master/patches/emacs-28/system-appearance.patch][system-appearance]], and [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/blob/master/patches/emacs-29/round-undecorated-frame.patch][round-undecorated-frame]] patches from the excellent [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][emacs-plus]] project.
- Emacs source is fetched from the [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs][emacs-mirror/emacs]] GitHub repository.
- Build creation is transparent and public through the use of GitHub Actions, allowing anyone to inspect git commit SHAs, full source code, and exact commands used to produce a build.
- Emacs.app is signed with a developer certificate and notarized by Apple.
- Uses [[https://github.com/emacs-ng/build-emacsng-for-macos][build-emacsng-for-macos]] to build the self-contained application bundle.

** System Requirements

- macOS 11.x (Big Sur) or later (uses Rosetta2 on Apple Silicon machines).
- Xcode Command Line Tools for native compilation (Emacs 28.x and later).

** Installation
*** Manual Download
See the [[https://github.com/emacs-ng/emacsng-darwin-builds/releases][Releases]] page to download latest builds, or [[https://github.com/emacs-ng/emacsng-darwin-builds/releases][here]] for the latest stable release.

*** TODO Homebrew Cask

** Use Emacs.app as =emacs= CLI Tool
*** Installed via Homebrew Cask
The cask installation method sets up CLI usage automatically by exposing a =emacs= command. However it will launch Emacs into GUI mode. To instead have =emacs= in your terminal open a terminal instance of Emacs, add the following alias to your shell setup:

#+begin_src shell
  alias emacs="emacs -nw"
#+end_src

*** Installed Manually
Builds come with a custom =emacs= shell script launcher for use from the command line, located next to =emacsclient= in =Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin=.

The custom =emacs= script makes sure to use the main =Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs= executable from the correct path, ensuring it finds all the relevant dependencies within the Emacs.app bundle, regardless of if it's exposed via =PATH= or symlinked from elsewhere.

To use it, simply add =Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin= to your =PATH=. For example, if you place Emacs.app in =/Applications=:

#+begin_src shell
  if [ -d "/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin" ]; then
    export PATH="/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin:$PATH"
    alias emacs="emacs -nw" # Always launch "emacs" in terminal mode.
  fi
#+end_src

If you want =emacs= in your terminal to launch a GUI instance of Emacs, don't use the alias from the above example.

** Build Process
Building Emacs is done using the [[https://github.com/emacs-ng/build-emacsng-for-macos][emacs-ng/build-emacsng-for-macos]] build script, executed within a GitHub Actions [[https://github.com/emacs-ng/emacs-darwin-builds/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml][workflow]]. This is why macOS 11.x (Big Sur) or later is required, as it's the oldest version of macOS available in GitHub Actions.

Full history for all builds is available on GitHub Actions [[https://github.com/emacs-ng/emacsng-darwin-builds/actions][here]]. Build logs are only retained by GitHub for 90 days though.

Builds are scheduled for 0:00 UTC every night, based on the latest commit from the =master= branch of the [[https://github.com/emacs-ng/emacs-ng][emacs-ng/emacs-ng]] repository. This means a nightly build will only be produced if there have been new commits since the last nightly build.

** TODO Application Signing / Trust

** Issues / To-Do
Please see [[https://github.com/emacs-ng/emacsng-darwin-builds/issues][Issues]] for details of things to come, or to report issues.
